# My first Portfolio Website

## Greetings
Hello! I wanted to showcase my first portfolio website. It is a fully responsive website that I built using HTML and CSS with a hint of Javascript for some animations.
Below are some of the images of my website 
### First page:
The first page is the home page as shown below:

## Here is the hamburger menu that slides out and transforms the hamburger into an X!

## I also animated my name to look like it is being typed out for some flare.
